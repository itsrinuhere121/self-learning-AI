Long-term causes of World War I\n4.1.I.A INT-9\nA. Rival alliances: Triple Alliance vs. Triple Entente SP-6/17/18\n1. 1871: The balance of power of Europe was upset by the\ndecisive Prussian victory in the Franco-Prussian War and the\ncreation of the German Empire.\na. Bismarck thereafter feared French revenge and\nnegotiated treaties to isolate France.\nb. Bismarck also feared Russia, especially after the\nCongress of Berlin in 1878 when Russia blamed Germany\nfor not gaining territory in the Balkans.\n2. In 1879, the Dual Alliance emerged: Germany and Austria\na. Bismarck sought to thwart Russian expansion.\nb. The Dual Alliance was based on German support for\nAustria in its struggle with Russia over expansion in the\nBalkans.\nc. This became a major feature of European diplomacy until\nthe end of World War I.\n3. Triple Alliance, 1881: Italy joined Germany and Austria\n\uf0b7 Italy sought support for its imperialistic ambitions in the\nMediterranean and Africa.\n4. Russian-German Reinsurance Treaty, 1887\na. It promised the neutrality of both Germany and Russia if\neither country went to war with another country.\nb. Kaiser Wilhelm II refused to renew the reinsurance treaty\nafter removing Bismarck in 1890.\n\uf0b7 This can be seen as a huge diplomatic blunder;\nRussia wanted to renew it but now had no assurances\nit was safe from a German invasion.\n\uf0b7 France courted Russia; the two became allies.\n\uf0b7 Germany, now out of necessity, developed closer ties\nto Austria.\n5. \"Splendid Isolation\" for Britain: After 1891, Britain was\nthe only non-aligned power and enjoyed relative security as\nthe world\u2019s largest navy and protection by the sea as an\nisland nation.\n6. Anglo-Japanese Alliance (1902): Britain sought a\nJapanese agreement to \"benevolent neutrality\" to counter\nthe possible Russian threat in India.\n\uf0b7 This signaled the end of Britain\u2019s \u201csplendid isolation.\u201d\n7. Entente Cordiale (1904): Due to the Anglo-German\nnaval arms race, Britain and France settled all outstanding\ncolonial disputes in Africa.\na. France accepted British rule of the Sudan.\nb. Britain recognized French control of Morocco.\n\u00a9 HistorySage.com 2015 All Rights Reserved\nThis material may not be posted on any website other than HistorySage.comHistorySage.com AP Euro Lecture Notes Page 2\nPeriod 4.1: The Great War\n8. Triple Entente, 1907: Britain, France and Russia\na. It was formed to check the power of the Triple Alliance\n(Germany, Austria, and Italy)\nb. It was not truly a formal alliance but one done in\nprinciple.\nB. The Anglo-German arms race\n1. Militarism led to a belief in the inevitability of a general\nEuropean war.\na. Germany overtook Britain industrially in the 1890s.\nb. Bertha von Suttner (Austrian)\n\uf0b7 She was the first woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize;\nshe opposed the arms race.\n\uf0b7 Lay Down Your Arms (1889) contributed to the\nfounding of Peace Societies in Austria and Germany.\n2. British policy was to have its fleet larger than the combined\nfleets of any two rival nations.\n3. In 1898, Kaiser Wilhelm II began the expansion of the German\nnavy to protect its growing international trade and\ncolonialism.\n\uf0b7 Haldane Mission (1912): Britain tried unsuccessfully to\nend the naval arms race with Germany.\n4. By World War I, both Britain and Germany possessed\nDreadnoughts\u2014new super battleships with awesome firing\nrange and power.\nC. Imperialism led to increased tensions between the Great Powers\nover Africa.\n1. Berlin Conference, 1885: Germany's late entry into\nimperialism led Bismarck to establish rules for carving up\nAfrica.\n\uf0b7 Germany aggressively set out to acquire colonies,\nsometimes coming into conflict with rival European\npowers.\n2. Kruger Telegram (1896): It triggered British anger at\nGermany when the Kaiser congratulated the Boers on their\nvictories over British troops in South Africa.\n3. In 1906, the Algeciras Conference settled the First\nMoroccan Crisis.\na. Kaiser Wilhelm had urged Moroccan independence\ndespite its being a French colony.\nb. Britain and Italy supported French dominance in Morocco\nand Tunisia.\nc. Britain, France, Russia, and the U.S. saw Germany as\npotential threat to dominate all of Europe.\nd. Germany became further isolated (except for Austria's\nsupport).\ne. Germany decried \"encirclement\" by other powers to\nblock Germany's emergence as a world power.\nf. The Triple Entente was created in response.\n\u00a9 HistorySage.com 2015 All Rights ReservedHistorySage.com AP Euro Lecture Notes Page 3\nPeriod 4.1: The Great War\n4. Second Moroccan Crisis (1911)\na. A German gunboat was sent to Morocco to protest the\nFrench occupation of the city of Fez.\nb. Britain once again supported France.\nc. Some observers believed this conflict would escalate into\na world war.\nd. Germany backed down for minor concessions in equatorial\nAfrica.\ne.\nD. Nationalism created a \"powder keg\" in the Balkans.\n1. The Ottoman Empire (\u201cthe sick man of Europe\u201d) receded\nfrom the Balkans leaving a power vacuum.\n\uf0b7 This was the so-called Eastern Question.\n2. Pan-Slavism, a nationalist movement to unite all Slavic\npeoples, encouraged the Serbs, Bosnians, Slovenes, and\nCroats to seek a single political entity in Southeastern Europe.\n\uf0b7 As the southern Slavs\u2019 \u201cbig brother\u201d to the east, Russia\nfocused on Balkan territories in the Austro-Hungarian and\nOttoman Empires after its humiliating loss in the Russo-\nJapanese War.\n3. First Balkan Crisis (Bosnian Crisis)\na. The Young Turks, led by Atat\u00fcrk (Mustafa Kemal\nPasha), set up a parliamentary gov't in the Ottoman\nEmpire.\n\uf0b7 Though somewhat politically progressive in its attempt\nto modernize the empire, the regime seemed weak to\nthe other European powers.\n\uf0b7 In 1911-12, Italy took the Turkish province of Libya\nshowing how weak the Ottomans had become.\nb. In 1908, Austria annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina while\nRussia failed to gain access, thus leaving Serbia frustrated\n\uf0b7 Austria\u2019s action violated the Congress of Berlin (1878).\nc. War was averted because Russia was not yet ready and\nFrance was not willing to fight over the Balkans.\n4. First Balkan War (1912)\na. Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria allied to successfully drive\nthe Turks out of the Balkans.\n\uf0b7 The fighting lasted less than one month.\n\uf0b7 Most of the formerly-Ottoman Balkan territories were\nnow divided up among the Balkan states.\nb. Serbia sought port access to the Adriatic Sea but was\nrebuffed when Austria created the state of Albania to block\nSerbia.\n5. Second Balkan War (1913)\na. Bulgaria was angered that Serbia and Greece had acquired\nsignificant territory in Macedonia and thus attacked both\ncountries.\nb. Serbia defeated Bulgaria in its quest for Macedonia and\ntemporarily gained Albania as a result.\n\uf0b7 Russia backed its Slavic neighbor, Serbia.\nc. Austria, with German support against Russia, prevented\nSerbia from holding onto Albania.\n\u00a9 HistorySage.com 2015 All Rights ReservedHistorySage.com AP Euro Lecture Notes Page 4\nPeriod 4.1: The Great War\nd. Serbia was frustrated as it still had no access to the\nAdriatic Sea; Albania gained independence.\ne. Russia was humiliated as it could not help Serbia acquire\nAlbania.\n6. The \"Third Balkan War\" between Austria and Serbia became\nWorld War I in the summer of 1914.\nII. Immediate causes of World War I\nA. June 28, 1914: Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the Austrian heir\nto throne, was assassinated by Serbian nationalist Princip\n(member of the ultra-nationalist Serbian \"Black Hand\") while\nvisiting Bosnia-Herzegovina.\nB. Kaiser Wilhelm II pledged unwavering support to Austria to\npunish Serbia: \"the blank check.\"\n1. Austria made harsh demands on Serbia by requiring Serbia to\npunish all forms of anti-Austrian sentiment and participate in\njoint judicial proceedings against anti-Austrian activity.\n2. Eventually Serbia agreed to most of Austria\u2019s terms except\njoint judicial proceedings which it wanted adjudicated by the\nInternational Tribunal at the Hague.\nC. On July 28, Austria declared war on Serbia.\n1. Claimed Serbia had not accommodated adequately Austria\u2019s\ndemands\n2. On July 29, Austria began bombarding Belgrade (the capital\nof Serbia).\n\uf0b7 This represented the first military aggression of the war.\n3. In response, Russia mobilized its armies against Austria and\nGermany.\n4. France, in response, mobilized on Germany's western\nborder.\nD. On August 1, Germany declared war on France.\n1. On August 3, Germany invaded Belgium (on its way through\nto France).\n\uf0b7 In effect, Germany turned the little localized war in the\nBalkans into a world war by attacking Belgium and France.\n2. In response, France declared war on Germany.\n3. On August 4, Britain declared war on Germany.\nE. Two opposing alliances emerged:\n1. Central Powers (Triple Alliance): Germany, Austria-\nHungary, Ottoman Empire, (also Bulgaria)\n2. Allies (Triple Entente): Britain, France, and Russia (later,\nJapan, Italy, Romania, and the U.S.)\n\u00a9 HistorySage.com 2015 All Rights ReservedHistorySage.com AP Euro Lecture Notes Page 5\nPeriod 4.1: The Great War\nIII. The Western Front\nA. The Schlieffen Plan\n1. German 42-day military plan to invade France through\nBelgium, defeat France quickly by sweeping around Paris, and\nthen redeploy to the east to defeat Russia before she fully\nmobilized.\n\uf0b7 When Russia began to mobilize on July 28 after Austria\ndeclared war on Serbia, the 42-day timetable had begun.\nGermany believed she had to attack lest she be saddled\nwith a two-front war against Russia and France.\n2. Battle of the Marne (September 1914)\na. After the Germans came within sight of Paris, French and\nBritish forces pushed the German forces back.\nb. The French army was led by General Joseph Joffre.\nc. The battle represented the end of mobility on the\nWestern Front.\n3. Why did the Schlieffen Plan fail?\na. Belgium\u2019s surprising resistance to Germany\u2019s invasion\nslowed down the German offensive into France.\nb. The left of the German line failed to lure the French army\ninto Alsace and Lorraine and destroy it.\nc. Russia mobilized quickly in the east requiring German\ndivisions to be sent there instead.\nd. The French and British counterattack at the Battle of the\nMarne was decisive in halting the German invasion.\nB. Trench warfare resulted in a stalemate and lasted four bloody\n4.1.I.B INT-9\nyears. SP-6/13\n1. A long line of trenches stretched from the North Sea to the IS-8\nSwiss border in the south (about 440 miles\u201425,000 miles of\ntrenches were built overall).\n2. Despite massive casualties on both sides, few gains were\nmade in terms of gaining ground.\n3. 1916: Massive casualties but neither side could break through\na. Battle of Verdun (February-December)\n\uf0b7 Germany sought a battle of attrition that would \u201cbleed\nFrance white\u201d and force it to sue for peace.\n\uf0b7 France lost 540,000 men; Germany lost 430,000; it\nwas the war\u2019s second bloodiest battle.\no General Philippe P\u00e9tain\u2019s leadership of French\nforces made him a national hero.\nb. Battle of the Somme (July-November)\n\uf0b7 British and French offensive aimed to break through\nthe German lines.\n\uf0b7 Bloodiest battle of the war\n\uf0b7 Losses of men: Britain 420,000; France 200,000;\nGermany 650,000\n4. Erich Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front (1929)\nlater illustrated the horrors trench warfare.\n\u00a9 HistorySage.com 2015 All Rights ReservedHistorySage.com AP Euro Lecture Notes Page 6\nPeriod 4.1: The Great War\nC. Technological advancements in war increased casualties.\n1. World War I represented the industrial revolution applied to\nwarfare.\n2. Machine gun\na. Perhaps the most important reason for the frightful\ncasualties that occurred compared to previous wars\nb. It was first used effectively by the Germans in mowing\ndown French and British offensives in trench warfare; it\nwas eventually employed by both sides.\n\uf0b7 One machine gun equaled the effectiveness of 40 men\nwith rifles; German guns fired 600 bullets per minute.\n3. Tanks\na. Artillery was now made mobile (in contrast to cannon\nused in previous wars).\nb. Tanks could navigate treacherous terrain but initially\nsuffered numerous mechanical problems.\nc. They were first used at the Battle of the Somme in 1916\nto smash down barbed wire fences but had little effect.\nd. They were not really effective until the last year of the\nwar, especially for the Entente.\n4. Airplane\na. Initial air fights consisted of pistols and rifles fired from\nplanes.\nb. Germany developed the first fighter plane (the Fokker)\nthat synchronized machine guns and propellers.\n\uf0b7 In response, Britain and France developed their own\nfighter squadrons.\nc. Britain used planes to bomb Zeppelin bases in Germany.\n5. Poison gas\na. Chlorine gas was used by the Germans early in the war.\nb. The impact of mustard gas was largely negated by the use\nof gas masks by the Allies.\nc. Germans later used phosgene gas and tear gas in concert\nfor its offensives.\n6. Submarines (U-boats)\na. Submarines, initially used by Germany, had devastating\neffects on Allied shipping throughout the war.\n\uf0b7 Britain and France also used submarines.\nb. The German use of U-boats was the most important\nreason for why the U.S. eventually entered the war.\n7. Zeppelins (blimps)\na. They were used by Germany to bomb London and other\ncivilian targets as a weapon of terror.\nb. Eventually, exploding shells were able to destroy\nZeppelins in the air.\n8. Radio\na. Wireless technology made communication more effective\non the battlefield.\nb. The Germans took advantage of Russia\u2019s lack of radio\ncapability and tapped into Russian phone lines to discover\nRussian battle plans.\n\u00a9 HistorySage.com 2015 All Rights ReservedHistorySage.com AP Euro Lecture Notes Page 7\nPeriod 4.1: The Great War\nIV. Other major theaters of the war\nA. Eastern Front\n1. The war was more mobile in eastern Europe.\n2. General von Hindenburg and General von Ludendorff\ndefeated invading Russian armies at Tannenburg in 1914.\n\uf0b7 Turned the tide of the war in the east\n3. Though numerically superior, the Russians were poorly\norganized and suffered horrific casualties at the hands of the\nGermans.\n4. Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Dec. 1917): Vladimir Lenin, after\nthe Bolshevik Revolution, took Russia out of the war but was\nforced to give Germans 1/4 of Russia\u2019s European territory.\nB. Gallipoli Campaign (1915)\n4.1.I.D INT-11\n1. British, Australian, and New Zealand forces failed to take the\nSP-14\nDardanelles as a step toward taking Constantinople and\ndefeating the Turks.\n\uf0b7 Taking control of the Dardanelles would have allowed\nRussia to receive increased supplies from the Allies and\nplay a larger naval role in the war against the Ottoman\nEmpire.\n2. 200,000 British troops were killed or wounded; about\n500,000 total.\n3. Gallipoli represents one of the great Ottoman victories of the\nwar and a huge defeat for the Allies.\nC. Middle East\n1. Britain took great steps to protect the Suez Canal in Egypt.\n2. The British gained support from Arab tribes who resented\nOttoman domination of the region.\n3. Arab revolts against the Turks throughout the war ended\nthe Ottoman Empire\u2019s grip on the Middle East.\n\uf0b7 The Arabs received military assistance from such figures\nas Lawrence of Arabia.\n4. The Armenian genocide by the Turks resulted from\nOttoman claims that Armenians were cooperating with the\nAllies.\n\uf0b7 Perhaps a million Armenians died in what became the\nfirst of several genocides in the 20th century.\nD. Japan in East Asia and the Pacific\n1. Japan sided with the Entente during the war and significantly\nincreased its influence in the region.\n2. It conquered Germany\u2019s island colonies in the Pacific.\n3. It increased its sphere of influence in China.\n4. Japan\u2019s dramatic increase in the size of its navy and army\nled to its recognition as one of the Great Powers in post-war\nglobal diplomacy.\n\u00a9 HistorySage.com 2015 All Rights ReservedHistorySage.com AP Euro Lecture Notes Page 8\nPeriod 4.1: The Great War\nE. British and Allied Naval Blockade 4.1.I.B INT-9\nSP-6/13\n1. Britain\u2019s goal was to strangle the Central Powers.\nIS-8\n2. Starting in 1914, the Allies used its superior fleet and sea\nmines to cut the Central Powers off from overseas trade and\ncaused Germany to lose control of its colonial empire.\n3. Germany responded by sinking Allied vessels with U-boats.\n4. Lusitania, 1915: U-boats sank a British passenger liner\nkilling 1,200 (including 128 Americans)\n\uf0b7 This turned American public opinion squarely against\nGermany.\n5. Germany in 1917 began unrestricted submarine warfare,\nsinking all ships with its U-boats.\n\uf0b7 This was the most important reason for U.S. entry into\nthe war.\n6. By war\u2019s end, the blockade succeeded in strangling\nGermany, resulting in thousands of German deaths due to\nstarvation.\nV. \"Total war\": involved mass civilian populations in the war effort 4.1.IC SP-13\nA. Massive conscription drafted most able-bodied men in their youth. IS-8\nB. In some cases, civilian populations became targets.\n1. Early in the war, Germany used Zeppelins to bomb London.\n2. The British blockade resulted in significant starvation in\nGermany.\nC. News was censored; propaganda lionized men at the front and\ndehumanized the enemy.\n1. Intense nationalism demanded support from the entire\npopulation.\n2. Some historians contend that Germany increased its\nbelligerency in the 1890s in order to rally the masses behind\nthe government and slow down the growth of the SPD.\na. In 1914, the SPD (then the largest party in the\nReichstag) agreed to support the war as part of the \u201ccivil\npeace\u201d with the Kaiser\u2014the burgfrieden.\nb. The same may have also been true in Britain as the issue\nof Irish independence dominated the headlines.\n3. British propaganda effectively demonized Germany as the\n\u201cHun.\u201d\nD. Economic production focused on the war effort.\n1. Free-market capitalism was abandoned in favor of strong\ncentral planning of the economy.\n2. Women replaced male factory workers who were now fighting\nthe war.\na. Women accounted for 43% of the labor force in Russia.\nb. Changing attitudes about women resulted in increased\nrights after the war (Britain, Germany, Austria and the\nU.S.)\n3. Labor unions supported the war effort and saw increased\ninfluence and prestige due to increased demand for labor.\n4. The rationing of food and scarce commodities was instituted.\n\u00a9 HistorySage.com 2015 All Rights ReservedHistorySage.com AP Euro Lecture Notes Page 9\nPeriod 4.1: The Great War\n5. Civilians financed the war by buying war bonds.\nE. Each side aimed at \u201cstarving out\u201d the enemy by cutting off vital\nsupplies to the civilian population.\nF. Increase in centralized control by warring regimes\n1. In France, Georges Clemenceau created a dictatorship\nduring the war.\n2. Germany became the world's first totalitarian regime in order\nto control the war effort.\n\uf0b7 In large part, the impact of the British blockade resulted\nin an increasingly repressive gov\u2019t in Germany.\n3. The British economy was largely planned and regulated.\nG. War promoted greater social equality, thus blurring class\ndistinctions and lessening the gap between rich and poor.\nVI. Diplomacy during the war\nA. 1915: neutral Italy entered the war against the Central Powers 4.1.I.A INT-9\n(its former allies) with the promise of some Austrian and Balkan SP- 17/18\nterritory\u2014Italia Irredenta (\u201cunredeemed Italy\u201d)\u2014and some\nGerman colonies and Turkish territories.\n4.1.I.D INT-11\nB. Zimmerman Note: Germany proposed an alliance with Mexico\nSP-14\nagainst the U.S.\n1. Mexico would receive much of the southwestern U.S. (Texas,\nArizona, New Mexico) if the Central Powers won.\n2. Mexico refused.\nC. Balfour Note (1917): Arabs and Jews in Palestine were\npromised autonomy if they joined the Allies.\n1. Britain declared sympathy for Zionism\u2014the idea of a Jewish\nhomeland in Palestine.\n2. The new policy seemed to contradict British support for Arab\nnationalism as a new Jewish state would require Arab lands to\nbe given up in Palestine.\nD. Wilsonian Idealism: the Fourteen Points (January 1918) 4.1.I.E INT-8\nSP-14\n1. U.S. plan to end the war along liberal, democratic lines\n2. Provisions:\na. Abolish secret treaties\nb. Freedom of the seas\nc. Remove economic barriers (e.g. tariffs)\nd. Reduce armament burdens\ne. \u201cSelf-determination\u201d: Promise of independence to\noppressed minority groups (e.g. Poles and Czechs),\nmillions of which lived in Germany and Austria-Hungary.\nf. Adjustment of colonial claims in interests of both native\npeoples and colonizers\ng. German evacuation of Russia; restoration of Belgium;\nreturn of Alsace-Lorraine to France; evacuation and\nrestoration of the Balkans; return of Schleswig to Denmark\nh. Adjustment of Italy\u2019s borders along ethnic lines\n\u00a9 HistorySage.com 2015 All Rights ReservedHistorySage.com AP Euro Lecture Notes Page 10\nPeriod 4.1: The Great War\ni. Autonomy for non-Turkish parts of the Turkish Empire\nj. 14th point: creation of an international organization to\nprovide collective security\n\uf0b7 Foreshadowed the League of Nations that was created\nafter the war\nVII. End of the War\nA. Meuse-Argonne offensive (spring 1918)\n1. Germany transferred divisions from the east (after defeating\nRussia and the subsequent Brest-Litovsk Treaty) to the\nWestern Front and mounted a massive offensive.\n2. The U.S. entered the war in time to assist Britain and France\nin stopping the German offensive.\nB. The Central Powers sought peace based on the Fourteen Points\n(believing they would get fair treatment).\n1. Germany and Austria-Hungary were wracked with revolution.\n2. Austria-Hungary surrendered on November 3, 1918.\n3. Germany agreed to an armistice which began on November\n11.\n\uf0b7 Wilhelm II was forced to abdicate and fled to Holland.\nVIII. Paris Peace Conference, 1919 4.1.II.A INT-8\nSP-6/14/17\nA. Big Four: David Lloyd George (Br.), Georges Clemenceau (Fr.),\nWoodrow Wilson (U.S.), Vittorio Orlando (It.)\n1. The Central Powers were excluded from negotiations as\nFrance was concerned with its future security.\n2. Italy left the conference, angry it would not get some\nAustrian and Balkans territories it had been promised in\n1915.\nB. Versailles Treaty, 1919\n1. Mandates were created for former colonies and territories\nof the defeated Central Powers.\n\uf0b7 Much of the Middle East was now controlled by Britain\nand France.\n4.1.II.C SP-6/14/17\n2. Article 231 placed sole blame for the war on Germany that\nresulted in its severe punishment.\na. Germany was forced to pay huge reparations to Britain\nand France.\nb. Germany\u2019s army and navy were severely reduced.\nc. The Rhineland was demilitarized; the Saar coal mines\nwere taken over by France.\nd. Germany lost all its colonies.\ne. German territory was given to Poland (the Polish Corridor\nseparated Germany from East Prussia), Denmark\n(Schleswig), France (Alsace and Lorraine), and other\nsmaller lands to Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and\nLithuania.\n3. League of Nations created 4.1.II.B INT-8\na. Germany and Russia were not included which weakened SP-6/14/17\nthe League from the outset.\n\u00a9 HistorySage.com 2015 All Rights ReservedHistorySage.com AP Euro Lecture Notes Page 11\nPeriod 4.1: The Great War\nb. The U.S. Senate failed to ratify the Versailles Treaty\nresulting in U.S. isolationism for two decades.\nc. The League thus was born as a mere shadow of what it\nhad originally been intended to achieve\nC. Impact of World War I on European Society 4.1.I.B SP-6/13\n1. Massive casualties: 10 million soldiers dead; 10 million IS-8\ncivilians dead, many also died from the 1918 influenza\nepidemic; perhaps 15 million died in the Russian Revolution\nand subsequent Russian Civil War.\n\uf0b7 Thus, the birthrate fell significantly after the war (although\nillegitimate births increased).\n2. The war promoted greater social equality, thus blurring class\n3.3.III.C IS-6/9\ndistinctions and lessening the gap between rich and poor.\na. The Russian Revolution abolished the nobility and gave\nwomen more rights than any other country in Europe.\nb. Women received the right to vote in Britain the same\nyear that the war ended; Germany soon followed.\nc. The nobility in Germany, Austria and Russia lost much of\nits influence and prestige.\nd. During the war, women took over the jobs of men who\nwere fighting the war (but were paid lower wages).\n3. Dissent increased as the war continued.\n4.1.I.C/E SP-6/13/14\na. Tsar Nicholas II was overthrown by the Provisional gov\u2019t in IS-8\nFebruary 1917, who was then overthrown by the\nBolsheviks in November due to mounting war casualties.\nb. Irish Republicans staged an insurrection\u2014the Easter\nRebellion\u2014in England in 1916.\n\uf0b7 They were inspired by British conscription of soldiers\nthat began in 1916.\nc. In Germany, militant socialists and anti-war activists\nRosa Luxembourg and Clara Zetkin were imprisoned for\ntrying to convince fellow socialists not to support the war\neffort.\nd. Large crowds of women in France, Austria and Italy\nprotested working conditions or high prices.\ne. Government censorship existed in virtually every country\nand people increasingly grew dissatisfied with the\nintegrity of their governments.\n4. End to long-standing royal dynasties\na. Habsburg dynasty removed in Austria (had lasted 500\nyears)\nb. Romanov dynasty removed in Russia (had lasted 300\nyears)\nc. Hohenzollern dynasty removed in Germany (had lasted 300\nyears)\nd. Ottoman Empire destroyed (had lasted 500 years)\n5. The political map of Europe was redrawn.\na. Creation of the new states of Poland, Czechoslovakia,\nHungary, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and\nYugoslavia\n\uf0b7 Albania regained its sovereignty\n\u00a9 HistorySage.com 2015 All Rights ReservedHistorySage.com AP Euro Lecture Notes Page 12\nPeriod 4.1: The Great War\nb. Germany was split in two by the Polish corridor (East\nPrussia was separated from rest of Germany).\n6. The Russian Revolution resulted in the creation of the world's\nfirst communist country.\n7. German nationalist resentment of the harsh Versailles Treaty\n4.1.II.C SP-6/14\ndoomed the new Weimar Republic in Germany.\na. John Maynard Keynes, The Economic Consequences\nof the Peace (1919): Predicted the harsh terms of the\ntreaty would hurt Germany\u2019s economy, and thus the\neconomy of the rest of Europe, and lead to significant\nfuture political unrest.\nb. German anger with the treaty was partially responsible\nfor the rise of Hitler and the Nazis in the early 1930s\n(although the Great Depression was the immediate\nreason).\nc.
