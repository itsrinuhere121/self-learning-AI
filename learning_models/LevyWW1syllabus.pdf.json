The war marked\nthe emergence of the era of \u201ctotal war,\u201d involving the historically unprecedented\nmobilization of all of the technological, economic, and social resources of nations in\nsupport of the war effort. The Great War completed the transformation from wars\nbetween kings to wars between peoples. As Winston Churchill had warned in 1901,\nhowever, \u201cThe wars of peoples will be more terrible than those of kings.\u201d\nThe Great War was indeed, at the time, the most destructive war in history. It killed over\nten million men, wounded countless others, destroyed economies, and led to massive\nstarvation and political and social upheaval throughout Europe. It resulted in the collapse\nof some of the world\u2019s leading empires, the emergence of new nation-states states in their\nplace, the redrawing of the map of Europe, and the beginning of the \u201cAmerican Century.\u201d\nThe Great War contributed significantly to the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, and it set\nthe stage for the rise of Hitler, the Second World War, the Holocaust, and, indirectly, for\nthe Cold War. The Great War fundamentally transformed the social and cultural spheres\nas well. It shattered the growing optimism associated with what we now call the \u201cfirst era\nof globalization,\u201d characterized by unprecedented levels of economic, social, and cultural\ninteractions between states and societies in an increasingly interconnected world. The war\ntriggered profound changes in the workplace, the family, and gender relations throughout\nthe West. The experiences of the war also generated new literature, poetry, art, and film\nthat defined our images of what the Great War was like, and indeed shaped our more\ngeneral images of war.2\nFew were spared the war\u2019s destruction and other negative consequences, and few\nemerged better off after the war than they were before. This naturally leads to the\nquestion of \u201chow did it happen?\u201d A hundred years later, we have no conclusive answer\nbut a great deal of debate. 2014 marked not only the centennial of the Great War but also\nthe end of the first hundred years\u2019 debate regarding the war\u2019s origins (causes). As one\nhistorian commented, more has been written about the First World War than about any\nsecular event in the history of the world. Undoubtedly one reason for the absence of\nscholarly consensus on the origins of the war is its complexity. As the historian\nChristopher Clark argues, the First World War is \u201cthe most complex event of modern\ntimes.\u201d Another reason for the absence of consensus is that the scholarly debate about\nwhat caused the war has been politicized, entangled in the last hundred years of\ninternational politics and conceptions of national identity.\nThe year 2014 witnessed countless commemorations of the centennial of the Great War\nthroughout Europe, along with a tidal wave of new books, articles, and journalism about\nthe causes, consequences, and legacy of the war. Within two years there will be some\nform of remembrance in the United States, marking the centennial of the American\nexperience of the Great War. For these reasons and more, this is a good time for an\nintense examination of the Great War, a fundamentally transformative event that in many\nrespects marked the birth of the modern age.\nFOCUS OF THE COURSE\nThis seminar will cover many diverse aspects of the Great War. It will provide a broad\nunderstanding of the causes of the war, the conduct of war on the battlefield, the social\nand economic mobilization for war at home, the political and economic and social\nconsequences of the war, its broader cultural impact, and the ongoing legacy of the war.\nWe will complement this breadth of focus with a more detailed examination of particular\ntopics. Given the diverse backgrounds, interests, and disciplinary orientations of students\nin the seminar, I will allow students to select these topics for investigation, as those topics\nwill define their research papers for and oral presentations to the seminar. Students can\nchoose to examine the role of a particular state in the outbreak or expansion of the war; a\nparticular analytic cause of war, such as private economic interests or militarism; the\nmanagement of war economies; the social mobilization for war on the home front;\npacifist movements; wartime atrocities and other violations of the law of war; medical\ninnovations or nursing associated with the war; the nature of military strategy; the impact\nof war on the workplace or on gender relations; the nature of poetry, art, music, or\nfilmmaking during the war; American intervention in the war; the treaties ending the war;\nor other topics. I will say more about possible research topics, and offer suggestions, later\nin the syllabus and in class. Students having a difficult time coming up with a topic will\nbe encouraged to look at something relating to the causes of the war. This is a\nmanageable topic that has worked out well in my other classes.3\nBy spending a fair amount of time on a particular research paper, each student will\ncomplement his/her breadth of understanding of the many faces of the war with more\ndetailed knowledge about a particular topic. Collectively, that will generate about fifteen\ntopics that we study in depth. More importantly, however, students will develop research,\nwriting, and speaking skills. Learning how to define a research topic, gather and organize\nresearch materials, write a research paper, present one\u2019s argument and evidence to a\ngroup, and field questions about a paper is one of the most important things one can learn\nin college. This Interdisciplinary Honors Seminar is a good place to start, or perhaps to\ncontinue, developing those skills.\nPEDAGOGICAL OBJECTIVES\nThe seminar has several primary aims. One is to gain a general understanding of the First\nWorld War and its causes, consequences, social and cultural impact, and continuing\nlegacy. A second is to use the First World War as a vehicle to better understand war in\ngeneral. The Great War was unique in many respects, but it is still useful as an exemplar\nto understand broader phenomena, including the causes of war, globalization, the\ninterconnections between war and society, and historical memory, among other themes.\nIn fact, general theories of war in the field of International Relations in Political Science\nhave been disproportionately influenced by the experience of the Great War. A third aim,\nespecially for students analyzing the causes or termination of the war but probably for\nmany others as well, is to learn to make causal arguments, and to appreciate the kinds of\nhistorical evidence appropriate for confirming or disconfirming different theoretical or\ninterpretative arguments. Related to the causality theme is the need to understand\ndifferent kinds of causality (necessary and sufficient conditions, for example), and the\nrole of the comparative method and of counterfactuals in empirically validating causal\narguments. A final aim of the course \u2013 and in some respects most important of all \u2013 is to\nhelp students develop research skills: to plan and organize a research paper, write a\npolished paper, present a paper to a critical audience, and learn from feedback from the\naudience and from the professor. These goals and means of advancing them fit nicely into\nthe \u201cWriting in the Disciplines\u201d theme of the Core Curriculum at Rutgers.4\nREADING\nBooks\nThe required reading for the course includes four books, the last three of which are\navailable for purchase. In the approximate order that we read them, they are\nJohn Horne, A Companion to World War I.

New York: Basic Books, 2014.\nAll but the first of these books is available for purchase (or maybe for rental) at Rutgers\nBarnes & Noble Bookstore (100 Somerset Street, 732 246 8448) and possibly at New\nJersey Books (37 Easton Avenue; 732 253 7666). These books are also available, perhaps\nat reduced prices or in a Kindle edition, on the internet. I asked Alexander Library to\nplace on copy of each on Undergraduate Reserves. The first book, John Horne\u2019s A\nCompanion to World War I, is available as an e-book in the Rutgers Libraries system\n(which is fortunate, given its expense).\nArticles and Book Chapters\nThe required reading for the course also includes a fair number of articles and book\nchapters. As you will see, many of these readings are fairly short excerpts, so please do\nnot be deterred by the long list. All of these articles and chapters (but not the required\nbooks, and not selections from the Horne Companion volume) are available on my Sakai\nsite, www.sakai.rutgers.edu. Many of you may be familiar with Sakai. If not, go to the\nsite and then log in by entering your Rutgers ID and password. There should be a tab at\nthe top for \u201cFirst World War.\u201d Click that, and then go to \u201cResources\u201d in the menu to the\nleft.

I have not scheduled examinations or\nquizzes to formally test students\u2019 comprehension of the reading, but will instead evaluate\nthat comprehension based on student\u2019s contributions to our weekly discussions \u2013 in terms\nof both the quantity and quality of those contributions. Thus your active participation in\nclass discussions is important. It is a central part of the learning experience; it is a skill\nthat will serve you well in the future; it counts for a significant fraction of your grade\n(20%, plus another 20% for your oral presentation); and it makes the class a lot more fun\n\u2013 for you and for the seminar as a whole.\nThe more formal requirements for the class include a short statement of your research\ntopic, a preliminary paper related to that topic, oral presentation of your argument and\nevidence in front of the class, and a final research paper. I describe each of these below,7\nbut let me begin with the basics. All page lengths listed below are for single-space pages\n(with an extra space between paragraphs; one easy way to do this, in Microsoft Word, is\nto set the \u201cafter\u201d spacing to 6).\n1) Statement of topic for research paper. Due October 5 (anytime), at the latest. Email to\nme directly.\n2) Paper #1. Preliminary paper. Length: 2-3 pages, including a preliminary bibliography\nof at least ten sources. Due October 26 (anytime). Submit on Sakai, assignments tab.\n3) Paper #2. Research paper. Due Friday December 18, noon. The length might vary\ndepending on the project, but most papers should fall in the 10 -14 page range. Submit on\nSakai, assignments tab.\nThere is no mid-term or final examination.\nGrading System\nYour final grade for the course will be calculated as follows:\ndue date\nstatement of research paper topic 0% October 5\npaper #1 15% October 30\noral presentation 20%\ncontributions to class discussions 20%\nresearch paper 45% December 18 (noon)\nStudents should email their paper topic (#1 above) to me, but they should submit their\npreliminary paper (#2) and research paper (#3) under the \u201cAssignments\u201d tab on Sakai.\nPapers should be in a Microsoft Word or PDF format. Please do not submit your papers\nin an .odt or other format; Sakai will not accept them. For those who prefer to work with\nother word processing programs, please convert your papers to a Word or PDF format\nbefore you submit it. If you are not sure how to do that, I am sure someone at university\ncomputing services can help. Please note that Sakai automatically runs papers through the\n\u201cTurnitin\u201d program. That program identifies passages in a paper that match passages in\nthe \u201cTurnitin\u201d data base, which includes previous student papers and internet sources. See\nthe paragraph on academic integrity below.\nNote that the due date for the final paper is basically determined by Rutgers final exam\nschedule. Instead of making the due date for the paper the day our final exam would have\nbeen scheduled, Dec 17, I am giving you an extra day. There is no final exam.8\nRESEARCH PAPER\nAs I indicated above (p. 2), you are free to choose from a wide variety of topics for your\nresearch paper for the seminar, though you must secure my approval. Because you will be\nspending a lot of time on the paper, and because the combination of your oral\npresentation and research paper counts for a substantial proportion of your grade (65%),\nit is important that you choose a topic that interests you. I will begin by outlining what a\npaper relating to the origins (causes) or expansion of the Great War might look like. In\nmany respects, a paper like this will be the easiest paper for many of you to write (which\nis not to say it will be easy). It also includes a preliminary paper that is fairly easy to\ndescribe, as I do so below. I will be able to give you the greatest guidance on this kind of\npaper; and if we have many people working on such topics, it will facilitate a lively\ndebate in the seminar on the origins of the war. I recognize, however, that their diverse\ninterests and disciplinary orientations will lead many students in the class to be more\nattracted to other topics. I return to those in the next section.\nPapers on the Outbreak or Expansion of the First World War\nYou are free to tackle the question of the overall causes of the war. Given the complexity\nof the Great War, however, I fear that you would quickly become overwhelmed by the\namount of information available, unless you are already familiar with the history and\nunless you have previously taken a course on the causes of war. A more manageable\ntopic would be on the role of a particular state in the processes leading to war. You could\nselect any one of the major states \u2013 Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France, Britain,\nor Serbia \u2013 which were most directly responsible for the outbreak and immediate\nexpansion of the war in the first few days and which have attracted the most attention\nfrom historians. You could also choose a state that joined the war at a later time,\ncontributing to the subsequent expansion of the war \u2013 states like the Ottoman Empire,\nItaly, Bulgaria, Romania, or the United States. There is plenty of information available on\neach of these states, with the possible exception of Bulgaria and Romania. It would not\nbe a problem if two or three students each wanted to focus on a single state (the United\nStates, for example). I doubt you would reach the same conclusions as to the primary\nfactors driving that state\u2019s behavior, and this would make for a lively debate in class.\nThe paper must be more than a historical chronology of the events for a particular state\nalong the road to war. You need to analyze the causes of the state\u2019s actions, and causes\ninvolve more than identifying a sequence of events. For each state, a key set of questions\nis what did they do? Why did they do it? What other alternatives did they have? How did\ntheir actions contribute to the processes leading to war \u2013 or, for interveners, to the\nexpansion of the war? As we will emphasize in our sixth meeting of the term \u2013 on the\ntopic \u201cAnalyzing the Causes of War\u201d \u2013 a useful framework for analyzing the \u201cwhy did\nthey do it? question is based on the \u201clevels of analysis\u201d: How important were (1)\ninternational system-level factors external to the state \u2013 factors like power, alliances, trade9\npatterns, etc.; (2) societal-level factors like public opinion, domestic economic groups,\ndomestic nationalist groups, etc.; (3) governmental-level factors like the institutional\nstructure of the regime, bureaucratic politics and conflict among different governmental\nagencies; (4) individual factors, such as who was in power, his/her unique world view,\npersonality, idiosyncrasies, etc.? With regard to national interests, what was the relative\nimportance of strategy interests, economic interests, and ideological values.\nIn addition, there will be particular questions for individual states, which you will come\nto appreciate after some preliminary reading about their role in the period leading up to\nthe war. For Germany, for example, one must ask some of the following questions: Why\ndid German leaders give Austria-Hungary a \u201cblank check\u201d on 6-7 July 1914? Did\nGerman leaders want a preventive war? Did they assume that they could localize a war in\nthe Balkans? Did they assume that Britain would stay neutral in a continental war, and\nwould they have held Austria-Hungary back if they had known earlier that Britain would\nintervene? One can identify another set of key questions for each of the other\nparticipants. These questions are often identified by historians in their narratives on the\npath to war.\nPaper # 1: The \u201cAlternative Interpretations\u201d Paper\nAnother set of questions that will arise for any country are those defined by debates\namong historians as to how to explain that country\u2019s behavior. Historians and other\nscholars vary in their interpretations of most historical events or periods, and the Great\nWar is no exception. This is particularly evident for the literature on each of the great\npowers and on the causes of the war as a whole, but it is also true for the lesser powers.\nOne thing that motivates professional historians is the aim of demonstrating than an\nexisting interpretation is wrong or at least incomplete, suggesting a new interpretation,\nand supporting it with evidence from documents or from other sources. If one accepts the\nconventional wisdom about a particular episode, then there is not much point to doing yet\nanother study. This norm is if anything more pronounced in political science and other\nsocial sciences. It is not enough for an international relations scholar in political science\nto offer an explanation for an event or class of events (like war in general) and show that\nthe evidence is consistent with their explanation. S/he must identify several alternative\ntheories and then try to demonstrate, based on the evidence, that their preferred theory\nprovides a better explanation than do the alternatives.\nKnowing what the alternative explanations for a given event are helps to frame your own\nstudy \u2013 by placing it in an existing intellectual context, and by highlighting what is\ndistinctive in your own study. Part of your final study should include a brief summary of\nthe leading alternative interpretations of your case. It is precisely for that reason that I\nhave made alternative interpretations the central focus of the preliminary paper (paper #1)\nfor students analyzing \u201cState XXX and the Origins of the First World War\u201d (or\n\u201cexpansion\u201d of the war, for those students examining a late intervener). The entire paper10\nis focused on identifying and summarizing three or four leading interpretations of your\nstate\u2019s behavior.\nSometimes it is fairly easy to identify alternative interpretations of a particular crisis or\nwar. Take the U.S. decision for war against Iraq in 2003 as an example. Some argue that\nthe war was \u201call about oil.\u201d Others emphasize the ideological aim of overthrowing an evil\ndictator and bringing democracy to Iraq and to the region, the fear (however misplaced)\nof Iraq\u2019s nuclear weapons program, the role of neoconservatives in the U.S. decision-\nmaking process, or the world view and personality of U.S. President George W. Bush.\nThus we have at least five alternative interpretations of the 2003 Iraq War.\nAlternative interpretations are sometimes evident in the title of books and articles. To\ntake an example from one of our readings for the class, the subtitle of Herbert Bass\u2019s\nbook on American Entry into World War I is Submarines, Sentiment, or Security. This\nreflects the debates among those arguing that American motivations were (1) the German\nsubmarine threat to U.S. commerce or to the principle of freedom of the seas, (2) the\nAmerican ideological commitment to liberal democracies in Europe, or (3) the\npreservation of U.S. security by maintaining a balance of power in Europe.\nIdentifying alternative interpretations is often complicated by the fact that it is usually\npossible to identify one or two variations of each alternative interpretation. You have to\nuse your own judgment as to whether a given variation is important enough to qualify as\na separate alternative interpretation. The more you read, the better the feel you have for\nthe cases and the easier it is to make these judgments. I am generally looking for three to\nfive alternative interpretations for a particular crisis or war.\nIf alternative explanations do not emerge naturally from debates among historians, you\ncan suggest some yourself based on your (admittedly limited) understanding of theories\nof war. One easy approach would be to adopt an approach based on the levels of analysis\nframework (see reading for week 6). This might lead to the identification of an\ninternational system level (or realist) interpretation, a domestic politics interpretation, and\nan individual-level interpretation. Some might want to add a bureaucratic politics\ninterpretation. Others might want to suggest two domestic interpretations \u2013 for example,\none based on the diversionary theory of war, and another based on the pressure from\npowerful domestic economic interests.\nMy primary aim in assigning this preliminary paper is to help you write a better research\npaper. One thing that separates many excellent research papers from merely good papers\n(in my classes, at least) is that an excellent paper often includes a discussion of why a\ngiven interpretation is better than the leading alternative explanations. Note that parts of\nyour preliminary paper, or preferably a revised version of it, can and should be\nincorporated into your final research paper for the course.11\nThis \u201calternative interpretations\u201d paper should include a bibliography of at least ten\nsources. You need not cite all of these sources in this preliminary paper. I will make your\ntask easier by sending you a list of recommended sources after I learn of your research\ntopic. The length of my list may vary depending on which state you select. In any case, I\nexpect that you will incorporate some additional sources into your final research paper,\nbeyond those I suggest.\nStudents interested in doing a research paper relating to the role of a particular state in\noutbreak of the First World War can simply write me a short email to that effect. If there\nis any ambiguity at all in what you want to do I will ask you to refine your statement.\nOther Possible Topics\nThere are many other aspects of the First World War worth studying besides its outbreak\nand expansion, and scholars have been doing so for over a hundred years. Earlier I\nmentioned a sampling of topics: the management of war economies; the social\nmobilization for war on the home front; pacifist movements; wartime atrocities and other\nviolations of the law of war; medical innovations or nursing associated with the war; the\nnature of military strategy; the impact of war on the workplace or on gender relations; the\nnature of poetry, art, music, or filmmaking during the war; American intervention in the\nwar; and the treaties ending the war. There are many other topics as well. If there is\nanother that interests you, feel free to mention it to me as a possibility, but I reserve the\nright to veto any topic.\nThis will be a different kind of paper from the one described in the preceding section.\nAmong other things, I will need in advance a better idea from you exactly what questions\nyou want to address and answer in your paper. We need to make sure that the topic is a\nmanageable one, and that we are on the same wavelength, before you begin your study.\nThis means that your initial (ungraded) statement of your research topic needs to be\nsomewhat more elaborate than the one-sentence description that will probably suffice for\nthe papers described above. You should start with a paragraph description (something\nabout as long as this one will suffice). I will then probably follow up and ask you to\nclarify your aims in certain ways.\nPaper #1 for other topics will also probably differ from the \u201calternative interpretations\u201d\npaper outlined in the last section, though I can imagine that for some papers it might be\nsimilar. Once I know your topic, I can give you a better idea of what kind of paper #1\nwould be most useful as a stepping stone to your final research paper (paper #2).\nAdditional Considerations for all Papers\nWhatever kind of topic you select, you should understand that this is a research paper. It\nis not a \u201cthought paper\u201d in which you provide your opinions on certain topics (which is12\nnot meant to question the value of such papers for many purposes). This paper requires\ncoherent argument backed by evidence. Your evidence requires extensive documentation\nin the form of footnotes and references. You can use whatever reference style that you\nlike, as long as you are consistent. In class I will discuss a couple of alternative reference\nstyles. Whatever style you use, however, please include a list of sources cited in a\n\u201cReferences\u201d section at the end of the paper. Please use footnotes rather than endnotes.\nPapers should be single spaced with an extra space between paragraphs\nYou will probably accumulate an enormous amount of information related to your topic.\nWhat will separate the very best papers from others is not the amount of information you\nhave, but how well you can organize it and incorporate it into coherent arguments backed\nby evidence.\nA Note on Sources\nFor most of the topics you will choose, there is an endless number of sources available.\nThe question is how to select from among these. Some professors believe that it is best to\nleave students on their own to learn through trial-and-error how to acquire materials for\ntheir research paper. There are benefits to that process, but I prefer a different approach.\nTime is short, information is overwhelming, some sources are better and/or more\nimportant than others, and it will be more efficient if I provide a list of some of the better\nsources on your topic to get you started. I will do this as soon as you email me about your\ntopic selection. I have more expertise on materials available on the outbreak and the\nexpansion of the war than on other aspects of the war, but I can provide a modest list of\nsources on other topics as well.\nI can also provide some general advice now. Whatever your topic is, the edited volume\nby Horne, A Companion to World War I, available as an e-book at Rutgers libraries,\nprovides useful bibliographies. In addition to the bibliographies at the end of each\nchapter, there is an \u201cExtended Bibliography,\u201d organized around a slightly different set of\ntopics, at the end of the volume. In addition, the three-volume Cambridge History of the\nFirst World War, edited by Jay Winter, which is on undergraduate reserves at Alexander\nLibrary, is a great source for references on a wide variety of topics. Like the Horne\nvolume, the Cambridge volumes have bibliographies at the end of each chapter. They\nalso contain \u201cbibliographic essays,\u201d organized by topic, at the end of each volume. I\nmade copies of the three sets of bibliographic essays and have placed them in a\n\u201cChronologies and Bibliographies\u201d file on my Sakai site (folder #0). For the many other\ngreat essays in the Cambridge History, you will have to go to undergraduate reserves at\nAlexander Library. I have also made a few other articles and chapters available on my\nSakai site. See folder #15.\nThe required reading from the first few weeks of the syllabus, along with additional\nreadings from my Sakai cite, the Horne book, and the Cambridge History, will hopefully13\nbe helpful in the process of selecting a topic for your research paper. What this means is\nthat the \u201crequired\u201d reading for the first five or six weeks of the course is greater than\nwhat appears in the syllabus, because of the need to read additional materials in order to\nselect your topic. The reading for weeks six and seven is also heavy. On the other hand,\nthere is very little required reading for the second half of the term (though I may assign a\nfew additional things depending on student presentation topics), when you will be\nworking on your research papers.\nNOTES AND WARNINGS\nAttendance\nAttendance is required at all sessions. If you are ill, or if there is a serious medical issue\nin your family, so that you will be unable to attend, please send me an email in advance.\nElectronic Devices\nPlease turn off your cell phones before class begins. If you need to have your cell phone\non for medical or other reasons, please provide me a note from your dean. You are free to\nuse laptop computers, iPads, or other devices to take notes, to look at the syllabus or\nreading material online, or to look up other factual material relating to the course, but not\nfor any other purpose. Texting, emailing, and general web-surfing is not permitted.\nAcademic Integrity\nThe University, the Honors College, the SAS Honors Program, and I each take academic\nintegrity very seriously. The University imposes heavy penalties for various forms of\nacademic dishonesty, including plagiarism. If you do not understand the meaning of\nplagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty, please see the Rutgers website on\nacademic integrity: http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/ , and more specifically the\nstatement at http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/academic-integrity-at-rutgers/. It is your\nresponsibility to understand Rutgers\u2019 principles of academic integrity, which are similar\nto those at most other colleges and universities.\nAt the most general level, all written assignments (and oral statements) must be a\nstudent\u2019s own work. The use of the words, phrases, or ideas of others, without proper\nattribution, is plagiarism, an act of academic dishonesty. Thus the submission of another\nstudent\u2019s work as your own is unacceptable. You can use passages in books and articles\nand online to help illustrate your arguments, but you must acknowledge the source. For\nany word-for-word passage, you must use quotation marks and indicate the source in\nyour footnotes (or in parenthetical citations; more on that later). You can also paraphrase\na general argument or passage, but you must cite the source. In terms of writing style, it is\nbest not to overdue the number of exact quotations, even with citations, because it\ndetracts from the perceived originality of your work. If you want to use a significant\namount of material from your own paper from one course for a paper in another course\n(like this one), you should always consult with the professor of the current course (i.e.,14\nme) in advance. Submitting the same work in more than one course, without prior\nconsultation with the course instructors, is an act of academic dishonesty.15\nCOURSE OUTLINE AND READING ASSIGNMENTS\nNumber indicates the week of the term (beginning Sept. 1 and continuing Sept. 15);\nletters represent multiple topics each week.\nFor each week, please read the different items in the order in which they appear here, not\nin the alphabetical order in which they appear on Sakai.\nNote: This is a preliminary course outline. Once students have selected their research\ntopics (hopefully by week five of the term), I will revise and expand the syllabus to\ninclude topics for presentations (and perhaps a modest amount of additional reading) for\nthe presentations during the last five weeks of the term.\n1a.
