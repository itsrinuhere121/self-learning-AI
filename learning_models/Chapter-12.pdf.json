As you have\nlearnt that, the native Indian sepoys were organized into 'Regular Army' after the First\nwar of Independence in 1857, and they trained and practiced the art of fighting under\nthe British troops and officers. It was during the First World War that they got a real\nfeel of the battle and faced the tough conditions of war. They were away from their\nhomes and in foreign land, braving the difficult conditions and the cold weather in\nEurope and later in Afghanistan, Africa and Burma. Indian soldiers won many gallantry\nmedals and were among the highly decorated soldiers. Their disciplined conduct made\nthem favourites in all the countries they had gone to. It is therefore important to know\nthe sacrifices made by our brave soldiers and officers who actually helped the allied\npowers win the wars.\nObjectives\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to:\n\uf0b7 explain why the first and the second World Wars were fought;\n\uf0b7 explain India's contributions in the battles of the WW-I;\n\uf0b7 list the major battle of World War-I and\n\uf0b7 assess the role to Indian army in World War-II.\n12.1 World War I\nFor the first time in the history of the world, many countries took part in a major war\nthat extended for four years from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 and which\naffected several countries of the world as well. It was called the Great War or the First\nWorld War. Before we see why the war was fought let us see the countries involved in\nthe conflict. These weres Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire\n(called the Central Powers) against Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Romania,\nJapan and the United States (called the Allied Powers). It was a war on very large-\nscale. Thousands of troops were involved and a large number of battles were fought,\nwhich caused extensive damage, destruction of property and death of numerous civilians\n7766\nMILITARY HISTORYModule - III\nIndian Army in World War I and II\nMilitary History of the\nand soldiers. As a Colony of Britain the British Indian army too was involved in the\nColonial Era\nwar. Let us study the major wars and find out why it was fought and how did the\nBritish Indian army contribute to the war effort of the British and allies.\n12.1.1 Reasons for the war\nMany causes can be attributed to the outbreak of the war. Of the several causes for\nthe starting of the war, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir apparent\nNote\nto the Austrian Empire, on 28 June 1914 at Sarajevo in Bosnia is considered as the\nspark. By this time, there was tension between the major European powers fuelled\nmainly by Germany's ambition to be a major power in Europe and as a competitor to\nBritain in commerce and trade. This had led to the formation of two power blocks in\nEurope, the Triple Alliance comprising Germany, Austria and Hungary; and the Triple\nEntente (entente means a friendly and informal understanding between countries) of\nEngland, France and Russia. Few would have imagined that the pistol shots in Sarajevo\nwould lead to a brutal four-year war and would draw in most of the world. The\ncountries had high nationalistic feelings, which contributed to economic policies, which\ncaused competition with one another. Besides, there was no effective international\norganization that could serve to a arbitrated between the nations.\nThe other reason was that countries were entering into secret alliances (alliances means\ntractics between countries to help each other militaries) based on the personal ambitions\nof the political leaders. Such secret alliances further contributed to suspicions about\nthe activities of the other country. Although many reasons contributed, the immediate\ncause as noted above was the Sarajevo incident in which the Crown Prince of Austria-\nHungary, Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated along with his wife on 28 June\n1914 in Sarajevo. Where was the war fought? See the map (Map 12.1) below to\nunderstand the countries where this war took place.\nMap 12.1 The spread of world war-I\nMILITARY HISTORY\n7777Module - III\nIndian Army in World War I and II\nMilitary History of the\n12.1.2 India's Participation in World War I\nColonial Era\nLet us now see the contribution of the Indian troops in World War I. At that time it was\nknown as the British Indian Army or British Indian troops. The Indian troops were\ndeployed in war without preparation and without proper clothing in a foreign land, in\nwinters. Yet they played an important role as part of the allied forces and their\nperformance in battle was remarkable and praised by all countries. Over 1.5 million\nNote soldiers from various parts of India including Punjab, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh,\nBihar and Tamil Nadu volunteered to take part in Britain's war effort. They fought\nboth in the Western Front and in the Eastern theatre of war and continued even beyond\n1918 in Afghanistan & Persia (up to 1920). The gallant Indian soldiers earned various\nmedals and honors for their services. These include: 11 Victoria Cross, 5 Military\nCross, 973 Indian Order Of Merit & 3130 Indian Distinguished Service Medals\nduring the WW I. As far as the number of regiments that took part in the war is\nconcerned about 12 Cavalry Regiments, 13 Infantry Regiments & several other units\nof other Arms / Services participated in the 13 Campaigns of WW 1. India was\nfighting on the British side and the only satisfaction that Indians could have was that the\nwar served as 'training ground for fighting in a modern warfare'. In 1914, at the outset\nof the war, the strength of the British Indian army was 23,000 British and 78,000\nIndian soldiers. India sent the following contingents to various theatres at the outset of\nwar:\nFrance 2xInfantry Divisions; 2xCavalry Divisions\n4xArtillery Brigades\nPersian Gulf 1xInfantry Division\nEgypt 6xInfantry Brigades; 1xCavalry Brigade\nIndia provided Britain with not just men and material, but finances as well to fight\nWorld War 1. India gave \u00a3100 million towards the cost of the war. An initial offer of a\nlump sum of \u00a3100 million was made in 1917. Three quarters of this amount was raised\nthrough War loans or bonds and the rest given by the Government of India. In terms of\ndirect monetary contribution India gave \u00a3146.2 million from its revenues. According\nto one account, there were approximately 172,815 animals, which included 85,953\nhorses, 65,398 ponies and mules, 10,781 camels, 5,061 bullocks, 5,692 dairy cattle\nand 369.1 million tons of supplies and stores, which left the ports of India for various\ndestinations. Within the first few weeks of the war, India supplied 70,000,000 rounds\nof small arms ammunition, 6,00,002 rifles, mortars and machine guns. Considerable\nquantities of shell cases were manufactured. The Army Clothing Department produced\n41,920,223 garments between 1914 and 1918. Raw materials like rough tanned hides;\nwool, manganese, mica, salt, timber, bamboo, raw silk, hemp, coir, tea, rubber,\n7788\nMILITARY HISTORYModule - III\nIndian Army in World War I and II\nMilitary History of the\npetroleum oils and foodstuffs were supplied. A total of 2,737,862 tons of items such\nColonial Era\nas rice, flour, atta, ghee, sugar, tea, tinned meat, grain and hay for animals, jam, biscuits\nand firewood were shipped from India up to March 1919. You can see the huge effort\nthat is required to maintain troops in war. More importantly, India had all these even in\nthose times and could proudly give to the countries that needed them.\nIntext Questions 12.1 Note\n1. Which incident in Sarajevo in Bosnia started the WW I?\n2. Name any three countries which were part of an Alliance in World War I?\n3. Approximately how many Indian soldiers took part in World War I?\n12.2 Major Battles of World War I\nLet us now see the battles in which the Indian soldiers were deployed. These are given\nin a chronological order of month and year. Indian forces were deployed during the\nWar. There were 7 forces, created to fight in different parts of Europe and Africa. The\nIndians managed to either win in attack operations or defend effectively a given area\nof ground. The war had new weapons, new tactics of fighting from a trench which is\nalso called Trench warfare. Imagine if enemy is sitting inside a dug out and you have to\nattack and capture him. The attacker is exposed and the defender is well protected\ninside the trench. That is why sheer bravery was required to win a battle. But it also\ncaused huge casualties in the form of death and injuries. What is Victoria Cross? It is\nthe highest medal given for an act of exceptional courage shown in battle. It is an\naward given by the Government of Britain. 11 Indian soldiers were awarded the Victoria\nCross for their courage and bravery in battle during the Fist World War.\n(i) Role in YPRES (BELGIUM)\nThe first major battle in which Indian troops took part was the First Battle of\nYpres, a small market town in Flanders bordering present day Belgium. In Ypres,\nBelgium, the allies consisting of British Expeditionary Force(BEF), French and\nBelgium troops took part in the attack against Germans. There were five battles\nfought in Ypres and the Indian army now called BEF fought in all the battles.\nTroops of the Indian Corps were fully committed there and suffered heavy\ncausalities.\nOn 22nd April 1915 the second Battle of Ypres began with the first gas attack in\nthe history of warfare. Again the British Indian Corps was called upon to fill the\ngap in the lines. Among the British Indian troops the warning was spread.\nIn those days there was no gas mask to defend against such gas attacks. The\nIndian army gave a good display of fighting skills and brave actions enabled the\nMILITARY HISTORY\n7799Module - III\nIndian Army in World War I and II\nMilitary History of the\nallies to gain victory over the Germans.\nColonial Era\n(ii) Role In France\nWith Britain entering the War on 4 August 1914, the Indian Army was soon\ndrafted to fight in the battlefields of France and Flanders on 6 September 1914,\nthis being the first time that Indian soldiers were deployed in Europe. The Indian\nCorps comprising of the Lahore and Meerut Divisions fought in the Battle of\nNote\nSomme, Passchendaele, Ypres, Neuve Chapelle where they provided half the\nattacking force for the British. Indian troops fought in Flanders where the bravery\nof Sepoy Khudadad Khan earned him the prestigious Victoria Cross (VC), the\nhighest decoration for bravery in war awarded by the Queen of England. He\nbecame the first Indian to receive this honour.\n(iii) Battle of Neuve Chapelle\nThe Battle of Neuve Chapelle, which took place in March 1915 was a British\noffensive in the Artois region of France and broke through at Neuve Chapelle.\nOn 10 March, the British began a thirty-five minute Artillery bombardment by\n90 x 18 pdr field guns of the Indian Corps and the IV Corps, on the German\nwire, which was destroyed within ten minutes. The bombardment was followed\nby an infantry assault.\nThe Garhwal Brigade of the Meerut Division, Indian Corps attacked with all\nfour battalions on a 600 yards front, from Port Arthur to Pont Logy. The Indian\ntroops forced their way through the German wire and took 200 yards of the\nGerman front trench, despite many casualties. 40,000 Allied troops took part\nduring the battle and 7,000 British and 4,200 Indian suffered casualties. The 7th\nDivision had 2,791 casualties, the 8th Division 4,814 losses, the Meerut Division\n2,353 casualties and the Lahore Division 1,694 losses. German casualties from\n9-20 March were 10,000 men. Indian army soldiers won many Victoria Cross.\nKhudadad Khan (129 Duke of Connought's Own Baluchis), Rfn Gabar\nSinghNegi, (2nd Battalion 39 Garhwal Rifles), Subedar Mir Dast (55 Coke's\nRifles Frontier Force), Naik Darwin Singh Negi (1st Battalion 39 Garhwal\nRifles), Lance Dafadar Gobind Singh (2nd LANCERS), and Rifleman Kulbir\nThapa (2nd Battalion 3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles) are few of\nthem.\n(iv) Role in Gallipoli Peninsula\nThe first Indian troops involved in the initial landings on the Gallipoli Peninsula in\nApril 1915 were the 21st Kohat Mountain Battery and the 26th Jacob's Mountain\nBattery. On 4 June 1915, the 14th Sikhs comprising 15 British Officers, 14\n8800\nMILITARY HISTORYModule - III\nIndian Army in World War I and II\nMilitary History of the\nIndian Officers, and 514 men, moved out to attack and capture Turkish trenches.\nColonial Era\nThe 14th Sikhs won glory in this advance and several soldiers won the Indian\ndistinguished Service Medal. The performance of the 14th Sikhs in the assault of\nKoja Chaman Tepe, which they failed to reach, was described by General\nBirdwood as \"A feat which is without parallel\". Though no decisive result was\nobtained and the Allies had no substantial gains from the Gallipoli Campaign, the\nIndian troops, including the Medical Services, displayed great bravery and Note\ncourage in the rest of the operations on the Peninsula and several were granted\nthe Indian Order of Merit.\n(v) Indian Army in Mesopotamia\nThe largest Indian Army force to serve abroad was the Indian Expeditionary\nForce D in Mesopotamia, under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir John\nNixon. The Mesopotamian campaign was largely an Indian campaign and saw\ndeployment of the largest Indian Army force abroad. The 16th Infantry Brigade\nof the 6th (Poona) Division was sent from Bombay for the Mesopotamia\nCampaign, under General Sir Arthur Barrett, when War was declared with Turkey\nin November 1914. A series of success followed including the capture of the\nport of Fao, dislodging of the Turks at Sahil; capture of Basra, which was a\nmajor step in protecting oilfields and refineries; storming of Shaiba-Barjisiyah;\nand the submission of Khafajiyah, Amara, and Nasariyah. The campaign\nexperienced a setback at the Battle of Ctesiphon and the Indian troops retreated\nto Kut-al-Amara, where General Townshend decided to hold the position instead\nof marching down river towards Basra and thus, began the siege of Kut. Several\nunsuccessful attempts to lift the siege resulted in the Battle of Sheikh Sa'ad,\nBattle of Wadi, Battle of Hanna, and the relief attempt by General George\nGorringe, usually referred to as the First Battle of Kut. The total casualties during\nMesopotamia Campaign amounted to 92,501. Nayak Shamad khan (89 Punjab\nregiment,), Lance Nayak Lala (41Dogra Regiment) and sepoy Chhata Singh (9\nBhopal Infantry) won prestigious Victoria cross in Mesopotania.\n(vi) Indian Army in Egypt and Palestine\nIndian soldiers of the Sirhind Brigade were part of the first troops providing the\ndefence of the Suez Canal. Troops from the Imperial Service Troops, which\ncomprised men from the Armies of the Indian states, were part of the Indian\neffort in Egypt, alongside the 10th and 11th Indian Division, the Bikaner Camel\nCorps and three batteries of Mountain Artillery. By 1917, Indian troops were a\nsignificant part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. On 23 September 1918,\nthe 15th Imperial Service Brigade comprising of the Mysore and Jodhpur Lancers\nundertook one of the most famous cavalry actions in the Great War and recaptured\nMILITARY HISTORY\n8811Module - III\nIndian Army in World War I and II\nMilitary History of the\nthe city of Haifa in Palestine. One of the lesser-known units of the Indian Army\nColonial Era\nwas the Bikaner Camel Corps. formed before the Great War. They later fought\nin Palestine and some of its personnel became part of the Imperial Camel Corps\nformed later in the conflict. Rifleman Karan Bahadur Rana (3rd Queen Alexandra's\nOwn Gurkha Rifles) and Risaldar Badlu Singh 2nd Battalion (14 Murray Jat\nLancers (Deccan Horse) won the Victoria cross for their extra ordinatory services\nNote at the front of Egypt/Palestine.\n(vii) Indian Army in East Africa\nInitial attempts at attacking German East Africa were foiled, until the arrival of\nthe Indian Expeditionary Force B consisting of the 27th (Bangalore) Brigade\nfrom the 9th (Secunderabad) Division and an Imperial Service Infantry Brigade,\na pioneer battalion, a Mountain Artillery battery and Engineers were sent to\nTanganyika with the task of invading German East Africa. The force under the\ncommand of Major General Arthur Aitken landed at Tanga on 2-3 November\n1914. In the following Battle of Tanga, Aitken's 8,000 men were badly beaten\nby the 1,000 men under their German commander Paul Von Lettow-Vorbeck.\nThe force re-embarked on 5 November 1914, having suffered 817 casualties\nand the loss of several hundred rifles, 16 machine guns and 600,000 rounds of\nammunition.\nActivity 12.1\nTake a world map and locate the places where the Indian soldiers fought a battle\nduring World War I. Name the countries where the wars were fought.\nIntext Questions 12.1\n1. How many Indian soldiers won the Victoria Cross in World War I?\n2.

From which year to which year did the War take place?\n12.3 Indian Army's Participation in World War II\nWe have learnt that the First World War was fought because countries did not trust\neach other and wanted to establish their power over others. Something similar happened\nduring the Second World War. Adolf Hitler wanted to establish the German might and\npower over entire Europe and Russia. Mussolini of Italy joined Hitler and later the\nJapanese also accepted this idea to form an Axis of power in Asia. That is why we had\n8822\nMILITARY HISTORYModule - III\nIndian Army in World War I and II\nMilitary History of the\ntwo fronts where the war was fought. One was in Europe and Russia and the other in\nColonial Era\nSE Asia. This war lasted from 1939 to 1945 and was called a Global War. This was\nthe war, which witnessed the dropping of the first atomic bomb at Hiroshima and then\nat Nagasaki by the Americans. At the start of the war in Europe, Japan had already\ninvaded China and captured most major cities of China including Shanghai, Nanking\nand Wuhan.\nThe Second World War (Map12.2) is said to have broken out with German aggression Note\non Poland on 1 September 1939. The war was fought between the Allies (Britain,\nFrance, Soviet Union, USA and their friends) on the one side and Axis powers\n(Germany, Italy and Japan) on the other. World War II was a titanic conflict that\ndwarfed even WW-I in scale and magnitude. Over 30 countries fought in this war and\nthe damage and destruction including deaths was colossal. Let us identify the continents\nand countries involved in this war. This war can be divided into battles on two Fronts,\nviz; Western Front (Europe and Africa) and the Eastern Front (SE Asia). Accordingly\nthe countries formed alliances with the Axis Powers consisting of Germany, Italy and\nJapan and the Allies with balance of Europe, Russia and USA.\nMap 12.2 Map of the World War II 1939-1945 - World Atlas\nAs we have seen in WW I, Great Britain became an automatic ally and got involved in\nthe war. Therefore, Indian troops, which had contributed tremendous to success in the\nprevious war, became a natural choice because of their courage, loyalty and discipline.\nIndian army by then had earned the privilege of being a very reliable and much needed\nforce for any war. Let us see how and where did all the Indian soldiers fight this time.\nBut before that you must understand some words used in military to describe wars\nand battles. What is a Theatre of Operation? In the context of military it signifies an\narea where war is fought. In ancient times there was a chosen battleground to fight. As\nforces became large and countries got involved, the capture of large areas required\nseparate planning and coordination. The term Theatre of Operation was coined to\nsignify specific areas where battles will be fought in order to achieve the desired aims.\nMILITARY HISTORY\n8833Module - III\nIndian Army in World War I and II\nMilitary History of the\nIndian army was deployed for war in Europe, Africa, Middle East and SE Asia. The\nColonial Era\nwar happened in three continents. In SE Asia they fought against the Japanese, In\nEthiopia against the Italians, in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt against both the Italians and\nthe Germans, and in Italy against the Germans.\n12.3.1 Eastern Theatre\nHaving planned the operations in detail and mustered adequate forces, the Japanese\nNote\noffensive commenced on 8 December 1941, by a simultaneous air and naval\nbombardment of Hong Kong (from mainland China) and Malaya peninsula (from\nThailand), along with the attack on Pearl Harbor a day prior. The Allies were deceived\ninto believing the direction of attack and were surprised when the attacks took place.\nThe Japanese quickly captured parts of Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and\nBurma. They had reached Manipur, Mizoram and Imphal. It is here that Indian troops\nhalted the advance of japanese by theirs sheer grit and determination and turned the\ncourse of the war.\nIn Malaya, the Allied troops fought to stop the offensive by occupying successive\ndelaying positions based on rivers, road communications, towns and villages, but were\nby-passed by the Japanese Forces, who adopted the tactics of infiltration (moving\ninside enemy territory quietly in small groups of men), encirclement (surrounding enemy\nfrom attacking from unexpected directions), establishing road blocks for cutting routes\nof withdrawal and launched multi-directional attacks, often through thick jungles,\nswamps and rubber plantations.\nFighting was severe from both sides, casualties heavy, but Japanese troops pressed\ntheir attacks fiercely, especially at night. The British under Field Marshal Slim started\nan offensive to drive the Japanese back. Five Divisions of Indian Army took part in the\noperations in the Arakans (Burma).\nThe US Air Force provided air support as well as Special Forces. The attacks were\nvery fierce and there were numerous casualties on both sides. Indians won 18 Victoria\nCross and many other awards for their bravery. The Indian army was well trained now\nto fight in the jungles and used the same tactics of the Japanese to infiltrate and hit the\nenemy from the rear. The well-planned and brave actions made the Japanese to\nsurrender, thus ending the war in this part of the globe.\nAmong the battles fought against the Japanese, the Battle of Kohima (present day\nNagaland) and Imphal (Manipur) are considered the fiercest battles in modern history.\n\"The Japanese regard the battle of Imphal to be their greatest defeat ever,\" said Robert\nLyman, author of \"Japan's Last Bid for Victory: The Invasion of India 1944.\" \"And it\ngave Indian soldiers a belief in their own martial ability and showed that they could\nfight as well or better than anyone else.\"\n8844\nMILITARY HISTORYModule - III\nIndian Army in World War I and II\nMilitary History of the\nField Marshal Claude Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army from 1942,\nColonial Era\nasserted that the British \"couldn't have come through both wars (World War I and II)\nif they hadn't had the Indian Army.\"\n12.3.2 Western Theatre\nLet us shift attention to Africa where the Allies were fighting the Germans and Italians.\nIndian troops were shifted from Asia to Africa where some of the most remarkable Note\nbattles were fought.\n(i) In Africa, the Italians and Germans had established bases in East Africa (Somalia,\nEritrea, Abyssinia) and North Africa (Libya, Tunisia etc). These bases threatened\nthe sea routes of merchant ships and would seriously affect trade and commerce\nof European nations. Hence, capture of these countries became a necessity. As\npart of Allied forces, three Infantry Divisions were deployed to fight and defeat\nthe Axis powers of Germany and Italy. Battles were fought in the Saharan deserts,\nEgypt, Sudan and Somaliland.\n(ii) Iraq and Persia were the next areas of battle where the oil fields were to be\nprotected against Germans. The Germans at that time were advancing into Russia.\nIndian army captured oil fields at Basra, Abadan. After the surrender of Iraq\nand Iran, the Indian forces were deployed in Iraq for internal security duties.\nThe Allies did not want the Germans to control Syria and Lebanon. These two\ncountries would also control the vital sea link of Suez Canal. Therefore, they\nlaunched an offensive to take control of these two countries. This attack was\nvery successful and Syria and Lebanon were quickly captured.\n(iii) In Europe, the Germans had taken control of France, Poland, Hungary and\nwere in the process to capture, Greece and Cyprus. By this action they would\ncreate a link between Africa-Europe and Iraq. Indian army took part in the\ncapture of Italy in October 1943, and later of Greece in 1944.\nINDIAN ARMY VICTORIA CROSS WINNERS IN WORLD WAR II\nWWII - East\nAfrica 1941\nRank First Name Last Name Regiment\n2nd Lieutenant Premindra Singh BHAGAT Royal Bombay Sappers &\nMiners 4th Bn (Outram's ),\nJamadar Richpal RAM 6th Rajputana Rifles\nMILITARY HISTORY\n8855Module - III\nIndian Army in World War I and II\nMilitary History of the\nWWII - North\nColonial Era\nAfrica 1943\nRank First Name Last Name Regiment\n4th Bn (Outram's), 6th\nCoy Havildar Major Chhelu RAM Rajputana Rifles\n1st Bn, 2nd King Edward\nVII's Own Gurkha Rifles\nNote\nSubadar Lalbahadur THAPA (The Sirmoor Rifles)\nWWII - Burma\n1943 - 1945\nRank First Name Last Name Regiment\nSepoy Fazal DIN 7th Bn, 10th Baluchi\nRegiment 2nd Bn, 5th\nRoyal Gurkha\nHavildar Gaje GHALE Rifles ( FF ) 3rd Bn, 2nd\nKing Edward VII's Own\nGurkha Rifles\nRifleman Bhanbhagta GURUNG (The Sirmoor Rifles)\nRifleman Lachhiman GURUNG 4th Bn, 8th Gurkha Rifles\nJamadar Abdul HAFIZ 3rd Bn, 9th Jat Regiment\nLieutenant Karamjeet JUDGE 4th Bn, 15th Punjab\nRegiment\nRifleman Ganju LAMA 1st Bn, 7th Duke of\nEdinburgh's Own Gurkha\nRifles\nRifleman Tulbahadur PUN 3rd Bn, 6th Gurkha Rifles\nRifleman Agansing RAI 2nd Bn, 5th Royal Gurkha\nRifles\nSepoy Bhandari RAM 16th Bn, 10th Baluchi\nRegiment\nLance Naik Sher SHAH 7th Bn, 16th Punjab\nRegiment\nNaik Gian SINGH 4th Bn, 15th Punjab\nGeorge's Regiment 1st Bn (King\nOwn) (Ferozepore\nSikhs),\n8866\nMILITARY HISTORYModule - III\nIndian Army in World War I and II\nMilitary History of the\nLance Naik Nand SINGH 11th Sikh Regiment\nColonial Era\nLance Havildar Parkash SINGH 5th Bn, 8th Punjab\nRegiment\nJamadar Prakash SINGH 14th Bn, 13th Frontier\nForce Rifles\nJamadar Ram Sarup SINGH 2nd Bn, 1st Punjab Note\nRegiment 33 Bty, 30\nMountain Regiment,\nHavildar Umrao SINGH Indian Artillery\nJamadar Netrabahadur THAPA 2nd Bn, 5th Royal Gurkha\nRifles\nWWII - Italy\n1944 - 1945\nRank First Name Last Name Regiment\nNaik Yeshwant GHADGE 3rd Bn, 5th Mahratta Light\nInfantry\nRifleman Thaman GURUNG 1st Bn, 5th Royal Gurkha\nRifles 6th Royal Bn\n(Scinde) 13th\nSepoy Al HAIDER Frontier Force Rifles\nSepoy Namdeo JADHAV 1st Bn, 5th Mahratta Light\nInfantry\nSepoy Kamal RAM 3rd Bn, 8th Punjab\nRegiment\nRifleman Sherbahadur THAPA 1st Bn, 9th Gurkha Rifles\nIntext Questions 12.2\n\uf0b7 The Second World War was fought from ________ to _____________.\n\uf0b7 The two Theatres of war were, _____________ and _______________.\n\uf0b7 _________ number of Indians were awarded Victoria cross in WW II.\nMILITARY HISTORY\n8877Module - III\nIndian Army in World War I and II\nMilitary History of the\nWhat you have learnt\nColonial Era\n\uf0b7 In both World Wars Indian army from all parts of the country was involved and\nthey were trained and practiced the art of fighting in major conflicts\n\uf0b7 Indian army fought bravely along with allied forces at both the western and\neastern fronts\nNote\n\uf0b7 The British who gave them various medals and honors for their services recognized\nthe bravery of Indian soldiers.\n\uf0b7 In view of the participation in the world war, Indian army had the experience of\nfighting modern warfare\n\uf0b7 India contributed to the war effort of Britain not only by sending troops but also\nmoney and material\n\uf0b7 In the Second World War II also Indian army took active role along with British\nside\n\uf0b7 The war was fought between the allied troops of Britain, France, Soviet Union\non one side and Axis powers comprising of Germany, Italy and Japan on the\nother side.\n\uf0b7 The Second World War was also fought in all theatres and Indian army was\nutilized in all places\nTerminal Exercises\n1.
