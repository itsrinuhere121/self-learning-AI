Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Because of an earlier\nalliance, Russia agreed to defend Serbia. They mobilized (prepared military) for war. So\u2026\nGermany declared war on Russia and France, which led\u2026\nBritain to declare war on Germany, which led\u2026\nAustria-Hungary to declare war on Russia!\nWho\u2019s is on which side now?\nAustria-Hungary\nCentral Powers Germany\nAllied Powers Britain\nFrance\nRussia\nItaly**\n** Note: Italy switched sides in 1915!\n2The War in Europe\nUnlike previous wars, European militarism provided new technologies to help each\nside, especially:\nMachine Guns Poisonous Gases\nAirplanes U-Boats (submarines)\nThey also used new strategies, especially\ntrench warfare: defending a position by\nfighting from the protection of deep ditches.\nThe area between opposing trenches was\ncalled no-man\u2019s-land. Much of the fighting\ntook place here.\n3What should the US do? Stay Neutral or Go To War?\n- Who wants to be at war?!\n- Many thought the War dealt with European\nReasons\nmatters, not American ones.\n- Although most sided with the Allies, many\nfor\nAmericans had immigrated from the nations of\nNeutrality the Central Powers.\n- American businesses were making lots of\nmoney off of the war, especially selling\nsupplies to the Allies.\nBy the end of 1914, the war had already become a stalemate (neither side could win a\ndecisive victory)\nSo how do we get involved?\n1) The Sinking of the Lusitania: German U-boat warfare sinks the Lusitania, a\nBritish boat with 128 Americans on board. Americans become increasingly\nupset over German submarines\nsinking non-military ships.\n2) The Zimmerman Note: German\nambassador to Mexico proposed an\nalliance between Germany and\nMexico against the US. For their\neffort, Mexico would receive the\nlands of New Mexico, Arizona and\nTexas. Americans found out about\nthis and become outraged.\nOn April 6, 1917, we declare war on Germany!\n4The United States at Home during the\nGreat War\nThe War Industries Board was created to\noversee the production and distribution of\ngoods manufactured by the nation\u2019s war\nindustries (steel, copper, rubber, etc).\nThe Committee of Public Information was\nformed to increase public support for the war\neffort. They attempted to show the importance\nof the US being in the War.\nCongress passed the Selective Service Act,\nwhich made all males age 21-30 register for a\ndraft. Numbers were drawn at random for the\ndraft.\nLiberty Bonds were sold to raise money for\nsupplies for the allies.\nThe Food Administration increased food\nproduction in the US to feed allies, while the Fuel\nAdministration increased production of coal,\ngas and oil.\nWorkers realized the labor shortage allowed\nthem the advantage to strike for higher wages\nand better working conditions. The National\nWar Labor Board settled disputes between\nworkers and management to prevent strikes.\nRole of Women: Took over jobs at\nhome, volunteered as nurses and\nambulance drivers in the army.\n5Establishing Peace\nIn 1917, Russia had left the War and the US had joined it. In Nov 1918, an armistice (truce) went\ninto effect, bringing an end to the war.\nEurope After the War\n- More than 8 million soldiers had been killed, more than 20 million had been wounded.\n- The economies of the nations involved were ruined.\n- The land and buildings all over Europe were destroyed. More than $30 billion in property had been\ndestroyed.\nFrance, Britain and Germany all were in debt.\nWilson\u2019s Fourteen Points\n- President Wilson came up with a plan for peace terms that would not be too hard on the Central Powers\na nd would not lead to another war. These were called the Fourteen Points.\n- Most of the Points dealt with specific nations or regions, some called for freedom of ships on the seas and\ns maller armies and navies, and an end to secret agreements between nations.\n- Emphasized Self-Determination: The right of people to decide their own political status. In other words,\nr ather than have an outside empire decide the political situation, the people could do it themselves.\n- The last point called for the creation of a League of Nations: an international congress designed to settle\ndisputes and protect democracy.\nMany Americans and Europeans did not like Wilson\u2019s Fourteen Points. They wanted to punish the Germans.\nParis Peace Conference\n- The Big Four (Wilson, British PM Lloyd George, French Premier Clemenceau, Italian PM Orlando) and\nothers meet at Paris Peace Conference figure out terms of peace.\n- They argue about what to do, each having different interests. Wilson is unable to convince them to accept\na ll of the Fourteen Points.\n- Other leaders all insist that Germany pay reparations, payment for damages and expenses brought o by\nt he War. Total cost: $33 Billion. They also split up some of the land that Germany had gained during the War.\nFina lly, the Treaty of Versailles was proposed. It included some of the Fourteen Points, especially the right of\nself- determination. New nations were created, while the Allies took over the former colonies of the Central Powers.\n6Problems with the League of Nations\n- President Wilson felt the most important part of the Treaty was the creation of\nthe League of Nations. It would include representatives from democratic nations\nand promote peace by working cooperatively to settle disputes.\n- The Senate, however, did not agree with the Treaty of Versailles and\nrefused to ratify it. They were concerned that if the US joined the League of\nNations, the US would be too closely involved with Europe. The US had gained\nlittle from fighting, but had lost tens of thousands of young Americans in the\nWar. In the end, the US signed a separate peace treaty with the Central Powers.\n***************************************\nEffects of WWI\nUS entry into the War in 1917\nMillions of deaths and widespread
